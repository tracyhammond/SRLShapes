/**
 * This interface defines the general contract for an SrlAlias. An alias is a way
 * to assign a specific name to a point in a shape. Named points are useful when
 * applying semantics to shapes, and when combining sub-shapes together to form
 * complicated larger, hierarchical shapes. An SrlAlias is simply a wrapper around
 * an IPoint, associated with a name.
 * <p>
 * It is generally the case, though not a requirement, that the point reference
 * in an alias be a point object used in the actual Shape. However, the contract
 * does not enforce this requirement so that you can assign aliases to "phantom
 * points." For example, you might interpolate corners on a rectangle where the
 * user drew in too much of a "rounded" style.
 * <p>
 * Aliases for a shape are unique based on their name. You cannot have two
 * aliases, even though they correspond to different points, if they have the
 * same name. Thus, the Comparable, equals, and hash methods should all operated
 * on the SrlAlias's name. Additionally, the name should never be set to null. You
 * can also have two distinct aliases that reference the same point, as long as
 * the names are not equal.
